                        master the soft skills required for being a software developer.

                        So far so good, the skills acquired have given me a mind-blowing push in my career as a software

                    <p> There's never been a better time to start a career as a
                        web developer because there is a consistent demand for developers who both write high-quality
                        code and experienced problem solvers who can design creative solutions.

                    </p>

                        transformed the way we do business globally, and
                        is disrupting industries from education to manufacturing. </p>

                        Completion Of The Course?</h3>
                    <p> By the end of the course, you will have gained
                        practice in two web-based programming languages â€“ JavaScript & Python. Youâ€™ll have built several
                        full-stack applications of varying complexity, and have experience working with a team in a
                        development environment.

                        Youâ€™ll gain confidence in tackling new technologies in an ever-changing field. Youâ€™ll have
                        gained foundational skill in many disciplines that touch web development â€“ managing complex data
                        sets, securing your applications with encrypted passwords, and testing and deploying your
                        applications to prepare them to scale. </p>

                    <h3 style="color:black ; font-weight:bold;">Should I Come Equipped With Anything?</h3>
                    <p>Yes, a laptop is required (either Mac or PC) with a
                        minimum of 4GB RAM with a storage capacity of at least 350GB. The course will walk you through
